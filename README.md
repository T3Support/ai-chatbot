### Security
- **Never commit your `.env`!**  
- Sessions are used for simple per-user threading.
- Only use on trusted servers.  
- For production, run behind HTTPS.

---

## Enable File Search in Your Assistant
- Ensure your OpenAI Assistant is configured with file search and files uploaded in the OpenAI console.

---

## Troubleshooting
- PHP 7.4+ and Composer required.
- Make sure `vendor/` exists (`composer install`).
- Permissions: The app writes temp files for threads.
